# Client Server Apps: Tasks from university

An interesting fact: each next task is a complication of the previous one.

## Lab1: Exploring ServerSocket

Lab1 implements the simplest client and server using Socket and ServerSocket respectively. Client and server could be started independently. Client sends a simple arithmetic expression and gets it's evaluation using a parser from <a href="https://github.com/DmitryKochetkov/Formal_Languages">another repository</a>.

## Lab2: Simple web server

Lab2 server provides the same functionality as Lab1, but it uses the web interface for interaction with client. It doesn't use ready-made solutions such as Tomcat or Apache, so basically this program implements simple manipulations with HTTP requests.

## Lab3: Adding a web interface

Lab3 involves using HTML+CSS+JS to create a web interface for Lab2 project. It also prepare us to Lab4, which is about working with database.

## Lab4: Adding a database

## Lab5: Using the Freemarker template

P.S. In my project Lab4 and Lab5 are parts of a whole web application on Java Spring Boot framework.
